	the dead sea scrolls and the future of the world
	the oldest known copy of Daniel is authenticated to
	around 160BC. in this writing we are told of the world
	events including the world kingdom that existed, as
	well as the kingdom's to come. every historical event
	recorded in this writing has happened perfectly. more
	impressively, the "babylonian chronicle" in the british
	museum (and other historical records) hold the daniel
	record to be sure from 605BC. there is more evidence
	to validate The Book, than to refute it.
	to put it in simple terms.. in a total 445 years from the
	oldest known copy of Daniel to the events that started
	in 605BC with babylon, in comparison with the 2170
	years of fulfilled history, we are left without excuse. the
	Prophecy of Daniel is not a historical rewrite.. it is a
	mathematical and Prophetic absolute. consider this..
	Daniel 2 tells us the world kingdom and the future of
	the world kingdoms. it lays them out in sure terms.
		babylon (gold age) 605-539BC
	37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of
	heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and
	strength, and glory.
	38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the
	beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he
	given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over
	them all. Thou art this head of gold.
		medo-persia (silver age) 539-331BC
	39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
		greece (bronze/brass age) 331-168BC
	39 and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear
	rule over all the earth.
		rome (iron age) 168BC-476AD
	40 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron:
	forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all
	things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break
	in pieces and bruise.
	revived roman empire-united nations (that will not cleave)
		476AD-The Kingdom
	41 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of
	potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be
	divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the
	iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with
	miry clay.
	42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and
	part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and
	partly broken.
	43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay,
	they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but
	they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not
	mixed with clay.
	44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of
	heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be
	destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other
	people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all
	these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
	45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of
	the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the
	iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great
	God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass
	hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation
	thereof sure.
	rome broke up into 2 legs, and ultimately into 10
	kingdom's.. just like The Prophecy Says!
		5 kings from the Western Roman Empire
		Britain
		France
		Spain
		Italy
		Germany
		5 kings from the Eastern Roman Empire
		Turkey
		Greece
		Syria
		Egypt (including part of Sudan)
		Libya
	now the nations are trying to come together. united
	nations, etc.. they will (NOT) come together! buckle up,
	because the global economy and the mark of the beast
	are next.
	the history of world nations, their terms of reign, and
	every historical record cannot explain this anomoly. we must consider the evidence!
	The Kingdom Of The Lord
	Is Sure.. the question is "who will choose to learn from
	our history and consider Him?"
	is this simple enough?
	Jesus Is Messiah.. and you must study Prophecy if you
	doubt.. you eternity depends on Him.
	(JUST IN CASE)
	if you think i am adding the names of world powers to fit The Prophecy..
	Daniel 8:
	20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and
	Persia.
	21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is
	between his eyes is the first king.
	need more?
	actually r-e-a-d The Bible.
