There are loads of ways to create 3D graphics in HTML. JS-based, Canvas, SVG and even WebGL-based solutions are available, and all have their advantages, but there's also CSS. CSS is bypassing the need for images and being able to hook into the GPU for graphics acceleration. Plug-ins aren't required and CSS can live beyond a walled-in canvas on your page.
